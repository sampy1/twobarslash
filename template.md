# <div class='header'>TEMPLATE FOLDER</div>

`templates`

The template folder contains static content such that can be used as a starting place.
For example the readme_file_template.md file located in this directory. This file
can be copied, renamed, and edited to as appropriate. 

As lessons are learned the templates will be edited to suggest to better coding practices
it is left to the authors to remain consistent to the templates. These are just good
practice guides and starting places.
